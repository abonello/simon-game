 ## Milestone Project 
 
 ### Create a Memory Game

Build a simple single-player memory game inspired by Simon. Check out this 
short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4)
and [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))
to understand the rules of the game.


*Provide details in your README.md of the logic you have used to build your game 
as well as an explanation of how you tested your logic.*

## Plans for the Build
I intend to use two ways to build this game:
1. based on modifying the shapes of divs
2. use of svg

With regards to the logic I will use **jQuery** and will test using **jasmine**.  
I might use **Bootstrap**, but I have not made a final decision on this yet.

Version control will be taken care of by using **git** and **GitHub**.

## Layout of the game
The overall layout of the game will resemble the original physical game.  
One thing that I would like to have is the ability to use different sets of 
sounds and pitches. This will have the effect of creating different 
tonalities and melodies, resulting in a simple form of algorithmic 
melodic composition.
